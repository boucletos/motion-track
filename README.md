Patient Step Tracking Using a Camera Network
This academic project focuses on monitoring and analyzing patients' steps using a network of cameras. The system captures real-time movement data to evaluate gait, detect irregularities, and support clinical assessments. It leverages video processing and computer vision techniques to ensure accurate step tracking and analysis, contributing to improved patient monitoring and rehabilitation support.
